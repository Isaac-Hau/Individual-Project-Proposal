    "    - How did COVID-19 vaccination rates impact the severity and frequency of COVID-19 cases in different age groups?\n",

    "    - Independant Variable:\n",
    "        - Vaccination rate: how many people out of the population has received a vaccine\n",

    "    - Controled Variable:\n",
    "        - Age group: older people are tended to get infected more easily\n",
    "- Analysis:\n",
    "    - We could use a scatter plot with trend lines to determine the strength and correlation between vaccination rates and COVID-19 outcomes across age groups. Alternatively, a comparison of means could assess differences in outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated age groups.\n",
    "- Hypothesis:\n",
    "    - Higher COVID-19 vaccination rates within a population will be associated with lower hospitalization and mortality rates.\n",
    "    - Expected Outcome: \n",
    "        - Populations with higher vaccination rates will experience fewer severe cases of COVID-19 (i.e., lower rates of hospitalization and death)."
